Updating your HP printer Drivers regularly is an important aspect of keeping your devices working well and avoiding PC and Printer issues. If you are unsure about whether or not your Drivers are up-to-date, you should download a Driver Update Tool and run a free Drivers scan of your PC. The software will check if your HP Deskjet Drivers are up-to-date. If your Drivers need to be updated you can either search the HP website for updated drivers or register the drivers software to receive automated Driver updates for all your devices.

## How do I know if I need to update my Drivers?

If you are unsure of whether or not you need to update your Drivers, or indeed which Drivers may need to be updated, you can run a Drivers scan using a driver update tool (you will need to pay to register this tool but usually the Drivers scan is free). This will allow you to assess your Driver needs without any commitment. Alternatively, you can use the device manager to check if there are problems with any of your hardware devices.
